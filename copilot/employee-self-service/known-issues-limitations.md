# Known issues and limitations for the Employee Self-Service agent

As you consider previewing the Employee Self-Service (ESS) Agent, we want to provide a clear view of known limitations—along with workarounds and roadmap visibility—to help you plan effectively and set the right expectations with your stakeholders.

This guide includes:

- Current Platform Constraints: Some features, like multi-vertical/domain support, mobile readiness, and multi-language experiences, are still in progress and will be addressed in future roadmap releases.  
- Connector Considerations: Third-party integrations require setup effort and technical expertise across stakeholders in your tenant. Details in the sections below.
- Publishing & Deployment Nuances: ESS may not immediately appear in Teams or Copilot after publishing, and extra steps may be needed to make it visible and accessible to users.
- User Experience Gaps: Customizations like tone configuration, welcome messages ("Hello" topics), and sensitivity label recognition aren't fully supported yet but have guidance or planned support underway.
- Content Handling Limits: Semantic indexing has limits (~200 pages), and certain content formats (for example, link-only pages or Graph Connector content) may lead to reduced response quality.
- Licensing and Flow Execution: Only prepackaged Agent Flows are included in ESS. Custom flows may incur per-execution costs when supported post-July 2025.

Our goal is to be transparent, help you avoid surprises, and guide you toward quick wins using supported configurations and best practices.

## Full list of known issues and limitations

Applies to:

|Package |Version |
|--------|--------|
|ESS agent |1.0.0.70 |
|ServiceNow HR |v1.1.06 |
|Workday |v1.0.0.109 |
|SAP SuccessFactors |v1.0.0.43 |
|ServiceNow LiveAgent |v.1.0.0.0 |
|ServiceNow IT |v1.0.0.37 |

|Area |Limitation |Planned fix |Workaround / guidance |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------------------|
|Domain support |Limited to a single domain per environment (either HR or IT). |Multi-domain support within the same environment is planned for release in the second half of CY2025. |Begin with the domain that will deliver the most immediate value to your organization—either HR or IT. If you need both, consider creating separate Power Platform environments: one for HR and another for IT. |
|Third-party connector setup |Power Platform connectors can’t be used with on-premises gateway connections at this time. |There are no plans to include this in the future roadmap. |If needed, consider moving your key content to a cloud platform like SharePoint or ServiceNow. |
|Third-party connector setup |Hierarchical Permissions in ServiceNow Graph Connector doesn't work currently. |Support for hierarchical permissions is planned for release in the second half of CY2025. |If you need support for Hierarchical Permissions in ServiceNow Knowledge for ESS Agent, fill [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/BVvQktxXw1). This feature isn't Generally Available, and we're allowlisting tenants on request basis. |
|Third-party connector setup |Third-party connector setup (like Workday, ServiceNow, or SuccessFactors) takes time, can be complex, and typically needs someone with deep technical expertise. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To work around this, carefully follow the setup documentation and involve someone with subject matter expertise in configuring third-party systems. Alternatively, consider starting with SharePoint as your initial knowledge source. You can add ISV connectors once your IT team has the necessary expertise and capacity to manage the integration effectively. |
|Third-party connector setup |The ESS Agent only includes prebuilt 'read' scenarios for supported connectors. If you want to enable actions like time-off requests or approvals, wait for those to be supported |Support for more read/write scenarios is planned for release in the second half of CY2025. |Start with agent’s knowledge retrieval scenarios first. For advanced task completion scenarios, wait for those to be supported or set-up custom Topic workflows. |
|Third-party connector setup |Only supports User Principal Name (UPN) based user mapping for third party integrations |Support for non-UPN based mapping is under evaluation and targeting for post-July 2025 |Work with the third party provider to have UPN based user-mapping for integrations |
|Third-party connector setup |Only supports single sign-on with User Principal Name (UPN) mapping for Microsoft Entra |Support for non-UPN based SSO is under evaluation and targeting for post-July 2025 |Work with the third party provider to have UPN based user-mapping for integrations |
|Third-party connector setup |Third-party identity providers (IdPs) and third-party single sign-on (SSO) aren't currently supported. |We're currently evaluating the feasibility of including this in a future roadmap. |None currently. |
|Publishing |After publishing, it may take up to 48 hours for ESS to appear in Microsoft 365 Copilot. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To skip the wait, download the manifest in Copilot Studio and upload it manually to Integrated Apps in Microsoft 365 Admin Center. [Step-by-step guide](publish.md#workaround-if-publishing-takes-more-than-48-hours). |
|Publishing |The agent doesn't automatically appear in Teams or Copilot after publishing. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |Ensure the app is approved in Integrated Apps and assigned to the correct security group. For detailed instructions, refer to the publishing steps outlined in the deployment documentation. |
|User Experience |ESS isn't yet supported on mobile devices. |Support for both mobile access is planned for release in the second half of CY2025. |You can currently access ESS through the Microsoft 365 app on Android and iOS. However, some of the custom experience elements—like the official source badge, disclaimer, and certain visual features may not display as expected yet. We’re actively working to improve how they appear on mobile phones. |
|User experience |You won’t see the 'official source' badge when testing in Copilot Studio. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To see it live, publish the agent and try it in Microsoft 365 Copilot. |
|The agent doesn’t yet support many languages—English for now. |Support for multiple languages is planned for release by the end of 2025. |Begin with English-speaking users and regions—additional language support is on the way. |
|User experience |Currently, you can't fully configure the tone/personality of the agent. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |Influence tone using well-crafted starter prompts, disclaimers, and response phrasing to guide the tone you want. |
|User experience |The “Hello” topic isn't available by default and must be manually created and published as part of your ESS Agent setup. Without it, users may not receive a welcome message or clear guidance when they first interact with the agent. To ensure a smooth user experience, we recommend adding a custom “Hello” topic that introduces the agent, sets expectations, and explains what it can help with. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To ensure users have a smooth first interaction, create a custom topic that acts as your “Hello” or welcome message. You can name it something like "Welcome" or "Getting Started," and use trigger phrases such as “Hi,” “Hello,” or “Start.” In the message, briefly explain what the ESS Agent can help with and how to ask questions. Publishing this custom topic replicates the behavior of a typical “Hello” experience and help guide users from the start. |
|User experience |Sensitivity labels applied to content (for example, “Confidential” or “Internal Only”) aren't supported. This means the agent doesn't recognize or respect content restrictions based on Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels. |Support for sensitivity labels is planned for release by July 2025. |Since the ESS Agent doesn't currently recognize sensitivity labels, we recommend managing access to sensitive content by using SharePoint permissions or security groups at the document or site level. This ensures only the right users can access certain information, even if the content isn't labeled. For now, avoid using highly sensitive or restricted content as a source for the ESS Agent unless you're confident that access is already tightly controlled through permissions. |
|User experience |Clickable links aren't currently supported in the ESS Agent. This means the agent is unable to display clickable links directly within its answers, even if you included prompts designed to generate those links.  |Support for clickable links is planned for release in the second half of CY2025. |While clickable inks aren’t currently supported, you can still guide the ESS Agent to mention source names in its response. For example, within your topic content or suggested answer, include phrasing like “According to our HR policy in SharePoint” or “You can find more details in the ServiceNow article titled ‘Vacation Policy.’” This helps provide users with context about where the information is coming from, even if a clickable link isn’t shown. |
|User experience |Agent names have length constraints i.e. 42 characters max |No plans – dependent on Copilot Studio |Follow corporate naming conventions for agents that are not long |
|Licensing and payment |Any custom agent flows outside the standard ESS package incurs charges based on each execution. |Support for custom agent flows beyond the standard ESS package is planned for release by July 2025. |Until support for custom agent flows becomes available, we recommend using the prebuilt Agent Flows included in the ESS package. These flows cover common scenarios and are designed to work out-of-the-box, without requiring more configuration or extra charges. They’re a great way to get started and deliver value quickly while ensuring compatibility with the current ESS experience. |
|Licensing and payment |Pay-as-you-go billing users (non-M365 Copilot license) won't be able to access personal graph data (chat, emails, calendar, etc.), but will be able to access tenant graph like SharePoint and Copilot connector (graph connectors) |By design – there are no plans to change this in near roadmap |Plan suitable licensing for each scenario or persona to ensure employees can access the information they need. |
|Content related |Semantic indexing is limited to roughly 200 pages of content; anything beyond this limit won't be processed. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To stay within the ~200-page semantic indexing limit, consider breaking up your knowledge content into smaller, topic-focused libraries or SharePoint sites. Prioritize including only the most relevant and frequently used content in the initial knowledge source. Less critical or long-tail content can be stored separately and accessed through links or added later as needed. This helps ensure the most valuable content is indexed and searchable by the ESS Agent. |
|Content related |If a page only has links and no actual content, it won’t be part of the summary the agent creates. |By design - there are no plans to include it in the future roadmap. |To ensure these pages are included in the summary, add a brief description or context alongside the links. Even a short paragraph explaining what the links are for or summarizing the content they point to can make the page eligible for summarization. This helps the ESS Agent better understand and include the information during indexing. |
|Content related |You might notice lower-quality responses when the agent pulls information from Graph Connector content. |Enhanced response quality for Graph Connector content is planned for release in Summer 2025. |To improve response quality, prioritize using SharePoint or directly integrated knowledge bases as your primary content sources, especially for high-impact topics. If you must use Graph Connector sources, ensure the content is well-structured, includes clear headings, and avoids overly long pages or lists of links. Adding short summaries or key takeaways at the top of each page can also help the agent generate better answers. |

## Tips for getting started smoothly

### Start with quick wins

Connector setup—especially for platforms like Workday and ServiceNow—often requires coordination between IT and HR. For faster time-to-value, start with knowledge retrieval from SharePoint and ServiceNow, which are easier to configure and deploy.

### Get the right V-team in place

ESS deployments move faster when you involve the right stakeholders early. Align your v-team across HR, IT, and Business Owners using this guidance to streamline decision-making and remove blockers.

### Extend ESS actions

ESS comes with out-of-the-box actions for common Human Capital Management (HCM) scenarios—such as checking time-off balances, accessing HR policies, or updating employee information. If you need more, follow our topic authoring guide to create and customize more topics that meet your organization’s unique needs.
