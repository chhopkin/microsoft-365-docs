# Update your MX records to transition to the global Exchange Online service

The following steps describe how to transition from Microsoft Cloud Germany Exchange Online to the global Exchange Online service:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).

1. From the left navigation bar, select **… Show all**, and then select **Settings** to expand it.

1. Under **Settings**, select [**Domains**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818).

1. In the **Domains** page, the status for each domain is shown under the **Status** column. If your organization's domains point to Microsoft Cloud Germany Exchange Online, the domain's MX records need to be updated.

1. Select the affected domain, and then select **DNS errors detected** to view the details.

1. The page that opens has instructions showing how to fix the MX record. If your domain's registrar uses [Domain Connect](../setup/add-domain.md#domain-connect-registrars-integrated-with-microsoft-365), you can select **Fix my records** at the top. Otherwise you can follow the link in the wizard for step-by-step instructions for your registrar.
