> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in March 2026, the **Company**, **City**, and **ProxyAddresses** **field filters** in the User Activity tab will no longer be supported.
>
>To continue filtering activity data by **company**, **city** and **proxy addresses attributes**, you can join metrics from the Microsoft 365 usage report Graph API with your own data sources and build a custom dashboard in Power BI or another data visualization tool of your choice. The following Graph API reports include user-level detail: 
>
> [getEmailActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getemailactivityuserdetail)</br>
> [getOneDriveActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getonedriveactivityuserdetail)</br>
> [getSharePointActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getsharepointactivityuserdetail)</br>
> [getSkypeForBusinessActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getskypeforbusinessactivityuserdetail)</br>
> [getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getteamsuseractivityuserdetail)</br>
> [getYammerActivityUserDetail](/graph/api/reportroot-getyammeractivityuserdetail)</br>

> If using Microsoft 365 usage report Graph API is not an option for your organization, you can also export user detail reports directly from the Microsoft 365 admin center as an alternative.

This article is intended for Microsoft 365 administrators who want to understand what insights Microsoft 365 usage analytics provides and how the available reports support adoption and licensing decisions.

Use Microsoft 365 usage analytics within Power BI to gain insights on how your organization is adopting the various services within Microsoft 365. You can visualize and analyze Microsoft 365 usage data, create custom reports, and share the insights within your organization. You can also gain insights into how specific regions or departments are using Microsoft 365.

Microsoft 365 usage analytics gives you access to a prebuilt dashboard that provides a cross-product view of the last 12 months and contains many prebuilt reports. Each report provides specific usage insights. User-specific information is available for the last full calendar month.

The [data model](usage-analytics-data-model.md) that powers the template app includes user attributes from Active Directory, enabling you to pivot in certain reports. The following Active Directory attributes are included: location, department, and organization.

To start collecting data, see [Enable Microsoft 365 usage analytics](enable-usage-analytics.md).

Microsoft 365 usage analytics contains many reports detailed in the following sections.

You can access detailed reports for each area by selecting the data tables. You can view all prebuilt reports by selecting the tabs at the bottom of the site. For more detailed instructions, see the following articles:

- [Navigating and utilizing the reports](navigate-and-utilize-reports.md).
- [Customizing the reports](customize-reports.md).

## Data availability

- Most reports show the last 12 months of data.
- User-level details are available for the latest complete calendar month.
- Month values shown in reports always refer to the latest complete month unless otherwise noted.

## Executive summary dashboard

The executive summary is a high-level, at-a-glance view of Microsoft 365 for Business adoption, usage, mobility, communication, collaboration, and storage reports. Business decision makers use the executive summary. It provides a view into how some individual services are used, based on all the users who are enabled and those users who are active. All values of the month shown on the report refer to the latest complete month.

This summary lets you quickly understand usage patterns in Microsoft 365 and how and where your users are collaborating.

Each person with a Microsoft 365 license can install products on up to five devices.

All metrics are aggregated for the latest complete month. To view the content date, go to the table page and select the UserActivity table where the value under TimeFrame provides the reporting period.
