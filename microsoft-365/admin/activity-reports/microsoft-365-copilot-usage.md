# Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report - Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report provides a summary of how users adopt, retain, and engage with Microsoft 365 Copilot and its associated enabled apps, including agent usage. For Copilot activity on a given day, the report typically becomes available within 72 hours of the end of that day (in UTC).

## FAQ

### How is a user considered active in Microsoft 365 Copilot usage?

A user is active in a given app if they perform an intentional action for an AI-powered capability. For example, if a user selects the Copilot icon in the Word ribbon to open the Copilot chat pane, this action doesn't count towards active usage. However, if the user interacts with the chat pane by submitting a prompt, this action counts towards active usage.

### What's the difference between the user activity table and audit log?

Audit log data that powers Microsoft Purview solutions, such as Data Security Posture Management for AI (previously called AI Hub), is built for data security and compliance purposes. It provides comprehensive visibility into Copilot interactions for these use cases. For example, it helps to discover data oversharing risks or to collect interactions for regulatory compliance or legal purposes. It's not, however, intended to be used as the basis for Copilot usage reporting. Any aggregated metrics that you build on top of this data, such as "prompt count" or "active user count," might not be consistent with the corresponding data points in the official Copilot usage reports provided by Microsoft. Microsoft can't provide guidance on how to use audit log data as the basis for usage reporting, nor can Microsoft guarantee that aggregated usage metrics built on top of audit log data will match similar usage metrics reported in other tools.

To access accurate information on Microsoft 365 Copilot usage, use one of the following reports: the [Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report](microsoft-365-copilot-usage.md) in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or the [Copilot Dashboard](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard) in Viva Insights.

### What's the scope of the user-level table?

The user-level table in the report shows all users who were licensed for Microsoft 365 Copilot at any point over the past 180 days, even if the user later removed the license or never had any Copilot active usage.

### I assigned the Microsoft 365 Copilot license to users, but why is the 'last activity date' for users empty in rare cases?

Based on system constraints, some users might not have a 'last activity date' in the user-level table of the report under the following conditions:

1. The user used Microsoft 365 Copilot within a short time window (less than 24 hours) after the Microsoft 365 Copilot license was assigned.
1. The user later had no other Microsoft 365 Copilot usage up to the date on which the report is viewed.

### Why is the 'Last activity date of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or Outlook Copilot (UTC)' sometimes blank or newer than the actual date, even when users recently used Copilot features?

A known limitation might cause this problem. For various reasons, uploading client events data for Copilot features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook can be delayed. For example, if end users disconnect from the internet immediately after taking a Copilot action, the data upload is delayed.
