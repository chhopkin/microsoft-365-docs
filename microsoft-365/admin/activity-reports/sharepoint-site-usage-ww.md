# SharePoint site usage report - Microsoft 365 admin center 

The SharePoint site usage report provides a high-level view of the value you get from SharePoint. The report includes details about the total number of files that users store in SharePoint sites, how many files are actively used, and the storage consumed across all these sites. You can drill into the SharePoint site usage report to understand the trends and per-site level details for all sites.
