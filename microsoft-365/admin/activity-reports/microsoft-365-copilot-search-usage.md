## FAQ

### What user actions count as active usage of Copilot Search?

A user is active in Copilot Search if they have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license and perform an intentional search action by using the Copilot Search feature. Simply opening the Copilot Search page doesn't count as active usage. The user is only counted as active if they interact with the search box by submitting a query, searching for people, searching for a file, or searching for content.

### What platforms does Copilot Search active usage include?

Copilot Search active usage includes user activity within the Microsoft 365 Copilot app across desktop, web, and mobile platforms. The report counts any intentional search action that you perform on any of these platforms during the selected timeframe toward active usage.

### What's the scope of the user-level table?

The user-level table in the report shows all users who were licensed for Microsoft 365 Copilot at any point over the past 180 days, even if the user removed the license or never had any Copilot active usage.
