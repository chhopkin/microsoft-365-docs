# Microsoft Teams usage report - Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft Teams usage report provides an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users, channels, and messages. You can quickly see how many users across your organization are using Teams to communicate and collaborate. The report also includes other Teams-specific activities, like the number of active guests, meetings, and messages.

Select the **Export** link to export the report data into an Excel .csv file. This action exports data for all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. The exported format for **audio time**, **video time**, and **screen share time** follows ISO8601 duration format.

You can view the **Microsoft Teams usage activity** report for trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

> [!NOTE]
> Activity dates in this report are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Post counts attributed to a given day reflect messages sent between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM UTC, which might differ from your organization's local time zone.

To ensure data quality, the system performs daily data validation checks for the past three days and fills any detected gaps. You might notice differences in historical data during the process.

> [!Important]
> Data for a given day appears within 48 hours. For example, data for January 10th appears in the report by January 12th.
