You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. The exported format for **audio time**, **video time**, and **screen share time** follows ISO 8601 duration format.

The **Microsoft Teams user activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

To ensure data quality, we perform daily data validation checks for the past three days and fill any gaps detected. You might notice differences in historical data during the process.
