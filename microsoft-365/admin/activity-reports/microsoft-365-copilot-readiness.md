This graph shows the sum of users who could benefit the most from Copilot based on where Copilot provides the most value in day-to-day scenarios. By default, it's sorted by descending order across all rows by column **Suggested candidate for Copilot**.

Use the user table to get an at-a-glance view of which users are assigned a Copilot license, whether their devices are configured correctly, and if they're using a Microsoft 365 app that has Copilot enabled.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the Export link. This action exports the Microsoft 365 Copilot readiness data of all users with any engagement on Teams meetings, Teams chat, and Outlook email for Office docs in the past 30 days. By exporting this data, you can do simple sorting, filtering, and searching for further analysis.

To ensure data quality, the system performs daily data validation checks for the past three days and fills any detected gaps. You might notice differences in historical data during the process.

## Extra details for Suggested candidate for Copilot

The **Suggested candidate for Copilot** column in the Microsoft 365 Copilot Readiness report helps organizations identify users who might benefit most from Microsoft 365 Copilot as part of initial rollouts and pilot programs. Each week, the feature flags the top 25% of nonlicensed users within an organization. The flagged users are based on their consistent usage of the Microsoft 365 applications where Copilot adds value, such as Microsoft Teams and Outlook. Admins can use this information to prepare a data-driven licensing plan for their Copilot rollout. The following list contains key details about this feature:

- The feature analyzes the Microsoft 365 usage across the users that aren't assigned Copilot licenses each week. It then flags the top 25% of them as suggested candidates. This selection is based on app usage intensity in applications where Microsoft 365 Copilot provides value, such as Microsoft Outlook, Teams, and Word.
- The feature is only available to customers who purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.
- The feature doesn't rank users within the selected 25% group; there's no individual stack ranking among suggested candidates.
- Each week, the feature reevaluates the user base and suggests the top 25% based on usage metrics for the preceding 28-day period. Users that are assigned a Microsoft 365 Copilot license are removed from consideration. Over time, every eligible user in the organization can be flagged as a suggested candidate for Copilot.
- To support interpretability, several of the inputs to the suggestion model are also shown in the Copilot readiness details table. Users that actively used Teams meetings, Teams chats, Outlook emails, or Office docs over the preceding 28 day period have a "Yes" value in the columns corresponding with each of these applications.
- The intended purpose of this capability is to support organizations with the rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot by highlighting users who are most likely to quickly benefit from its capabilities based on their consistent usage of Microsoft 365 apps. It's not intended to be used to evaluate employee performance.
