# About administrator roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center

> Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube. These resources are especially helpful for small business admins who are new to Microsoft 365.

In order to perform tasks, such as adding users, assigning licenses, or configuring services, you must be assigned an administrator role in Microsoft 365 for business. Your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription comes with a set of administrator roles that can be assigned in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). Each administrator role maps to common business functions and enables people in your organization to do specific tasks in the admin centers. This article provides an overview of administrator roles, security guidelines to keep in mind, and links to related content.

## Watch: What is an admin?

Check out this video and others on our [YouTube channel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2198028).

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=09f25c9c-6c0b-4e0d-85c6-acd0964d39d9]

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in. If you can access the Microsoft 365 admin center, you're an administrator, and you can proceed to the next step.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Users** > **Active users**. (Or, go directly to the [Active users page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822).)

3. Select the user account for the person who you want to make an administrator. The user's details appear in the right dialog box.

## Before you begin

The [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) lets you manage Microsoft Entra roles and Microsoft Intune roles. However, these roles are a subset of the roles available in the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Microsoft Intune admin center.

- For the full list of detailed Microsoft Entra role descriptions you can manage in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see Administrator role permissions in [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).
- For the full list of detailed Intune role descriptions you can manage in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control).

For more information on assigning roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign admin roles](assign-admin-roles.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions, and that you limit the number of users who have administrative permissions. See [Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task).

## Security guidelines for assigning roles

Because administrators have access to sensitive data and files, we recommend that you follow these guidelines to keep your organization's data more secure.

| Recommendation   | Why it's important |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Have as few global administrators as possible  | Global Administrators have almost unlimited access to your organization's settings and most of its data. We recommend you limit the number of Global Administrators as much as possible. A Global Administrator could inadvertently lock their account and require a password reset. Either another Global Administrator or a Privileged Authentication Administrator can reset a Global Administrator's password. Therefore, we recommend you have at least a Privileged Authentication administrator in the event a Global Administrator is locked out of their account. |
| Assign the *least permissive* role    | Assigning the *least permissive* role means giving administrators only the access they need to get the job done. For example, if you want someone to reset user passwords you shouldn't assign the unlimited global administrator role; instead, you should assign a limited administrator role, like Password Administrator or Helpdesk Administrator. See [Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task). |
| Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrators   |  It's a good idea to require MFA for all of your users, especially administrators. MFA makes users use a second method of identification to verify their identity. Administrators can have access to user data, such as their name, email address, location, and so on. If you require MFA, even if the administrator's password gets compromised, the password alone isn't sufficient to sign in without another method of identification.  <br><br>When you turn on MFA, the next time the user signs in, they'll need to provide an alternate email address and phone number for account recovery.  <br> [Set up multifactor authentication](../security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md)   |

If you get a message in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you don't have permissions to edit a setting or page, it's because you're assigned to a role that doesn't have that permission. In this case, take one or more of the following actions:

- Talk to another administrator to assign you the correct permissions.
- Learn more about how administrator roles are assigned. See [Assign administrator roles](assign-admin-roles.md).
- [Contact support for Microsoft 365 for business](../get-help-support.md).

## Commonly used Microsoft 365 admin center roles

To view administrator roles, follow these steps:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [Role assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097861).

2. Select any role to open its detail pane. 

3. Select the **Permissions** tab to view the detailed list of what administrators assigned that role have permissions to do. 

4. Select the **Assigned** or **Assigned admins** tab to add users to roles.

   To view the full list of roles, go to the bottom of the list and select **Show all by Category**. For detailed information, including the cmdlets associated with a role, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

## Delegated administration for Microsoft Partners

If you're working with a Microsoft partner, you can assign them administrator roles. They, in turn, can assign users in your company, or their company, administrator roles. You might want to assign administrator roles to partners if they're setting up and managing your online organization for you.
  
A partner can assign these roles:
  
- **Admin Agent** Privileges equivalent to a global administrator, except for managing multifactor authentication through the Partner Center.
- **Helpdesk Agent** Privileges equivalent to a helpdesk admin.

Before the partner can assign these roles to users, you must add the partner as a delegated administrator to your account. The partner has to be an authorized partner. The partner sends you an email to ask you if you want to give them permission to act as a delegated admin. For instructions, see [Authorize or remove partner relationships](../misc/add-partner.md).

## Volume licensing roles

Volume licensing (VL) agreement administrators access their volume licenses in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

- VL Administrators don't have permissions to any other admin center information or functionality outside the VL section.
- Global administrators don't assign any VL roles and don't need to assign any administrator role to a VL Administrator for them to be able to access the VL agreement.
- Global administrators don't have access to VL information or functionality in the admin center, unless they're assigned to a VL role by a VL Administrator.

For more information, see [Manage volume licensing user roles](../../commerce/licenses/manage-user-roles-vl.md) or [contact the Volume Licensing Support team](../../commerce/licenses/contact-vl-support.md).
