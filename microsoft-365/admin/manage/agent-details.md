# Understand agent details in Microsoft 365 admin center

You can view and manage agent details for each agent listed in the agent registry within [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). When you select an agent from the list, you can view these details in a fly-out pane. The **Details** pane provides information and actions, as well as additional information provided within tabs. Each tab provides capabilities and details specifically for the selected agent. Many of the tabs are standard to all agents, but some tabs are provided based on an agent's capabilities. For example, if an agent is designed to provide information and answers from another agents, the **Connected Agents** tab is provided. In addition to providing information about an agent in the details fly-out pane, you can also select specific actions for the agent, such as **Install**, **Block**, **Uninstall**, and **Pin for users**.

## View agent details

To access the details available for an agent, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Navigate to **Agents** > **All agents**.
  The agent **Registry** tab will be selected.
3. Select an agent from the **Registry** list.
  The agent details will be displayed.

When you select an agent from the **Registry**, the details fly-out pane displays common actions available for the agent. Actions for the agent are described in the following table:

| Agent action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Install** | Deploys and installs the agent for the selected users at your   organizations. |
| **Uninstall** | Removes the agent. Members of your organization can't install or use use   the agent. |
| **Block** | Blocks the agent from members of your organization. They won't be able   to install or use the agent. Additionally, the agent will be removed from any   member of your organization who has already installed it. |
| **Pin for users** | The agent will be pinned in the UI (based on channel) where the agent was   deployed, so that the agent can be found more easily. Based on the users or   groups where the agent was deployed, you can specify who will have the agent   pinned. |

For more information about agent actions, see [Agent actions available in Microsoft 365 admin center](agent-actions.md).

### Tabs provided within agent details

The information, actions, and tabs provided in the agent details fly-out pane is based on agent capabilities.

The following table provides agent tabs based on agent capability:

| Agent tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Details](#agent-details)** | This tab provides a description, instructions, status, and other general details about the agent. |
| **[Users](#agent-users)** | This tab allows you to view and select the allowed users that the agent has been published to. |
| **[Data & Tools](#agent-data--tools)** |  This tab provides details about Microsoft Purview protections, such as capabilities, knowledge sources, and tools available to the agent. Also, provides Microsoft Entry   protection details, such as Agent User ID and Agent ID. |
| **[Security](#agent-security)** | This tab provides details about monitoring agent activity, protecting sensitive   data, and evaluating compliance gaps. |
| **[Permissions](#agent-permissions)** | This tab allows you to review and grant permission to data the agent can access and perform actions on. For more information, see [Agent permissions](#agent-permissions). |
| **[Certification](#agent-certification)** | This tab gives you a single place to review the trust and attestation signals that are available for the selected agent before you deploy the agent across your organization. For more information, see [Agent certification](#agent-certification). |
| **[Activity](#agent-activity)** | This tab allows you to connect the selected agent with other agents. When using the selected agent, users can get additional information and answers from the connected agents. You can connect up to 10 agents to the selected agent, excluding those added by the agent's maker. Depending on how the agent maker connected the agents, you may be able to remove them as well. You must make sure the connected agents are available to everyone who needs access. |
| **[Agent instances](#agent-instances)** | This tab allows you to connect the selected agent with other agents. When using the selected agent, users can get additional information and answers from the connected agents. You can connect up to 10 agents to the selected agent, excluding those added by the agent's maker. Depending on how the agent maker connected the agents, you may be able to remove them as well. You must make sure the connected agents are available to everyone who needs access. |
| **[Connect Agents](#connected-agents)** | This tab allows you to connect the selected agent with other agents. When using the selected agent, users can get additional information and answers from the connected agents. You can connect up to 10 agents to the selected agent, excluding those added by the agent's maker. Depending on how the agent maker connected the agents, you may be able to remove them as well. You must make sure the connected agents are available to everyone who needs access. |
| **[Computer use](#computer-use)** | This tab is used to allow the selected agent to perform action on behalf of the users and also access work data. Additionally, you can choose which websites are   allowed for **Computer use**. Note that Web search is required for **Computer use**. |

## Agent details

The **Details** tab provides details about the agent's intended purpose. This tab contains the agent's description, instructions, publish status, availability, publisher, deployment, agent type, channel, platform, last updated, sensitivity, and version. Use this tab to assess the agents general capabilities and state.

## Agent users

You can control how agents created in your organization are made available across your organization. You can configure the following agent availability options: 

- Who can discover and install an agent  
- Which users have the agent pre‑installed  
- Whether the agent is available organization‑wide or to specific groups

These options help organizations publish and install agents in a governed manner aligned with internal compliance and rollout policies.

### Agent availability and installation

Each agent includes availability and installation settings. The following table describes these settings: 

|         Setting  |            Description        |
|---|---|
|         Installed to  |            Controls which users automatically have the agent   pre‑installed.        |
| Published to | Controls which users can install and use an agent. |

### Set agent availability and installation

To set an individual agent's availability and installation settings, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Agents** > **All Agents** > **Registry**.
1. Select an agent from the list to manage.
1. Select the **Users** tab.
1. Select **Installed to** to assign users that will have the agent pre-installed. Choose from the following options:
   - Just me
   - Entire organization
   - Specific users/groups
1. Select **Published to** to select users that can install and use the agent. Choose from the following options:
   - No users in the organization can install
   - All users in the organization can install
   - Specific users/groups can install
1. Select **Update** to save these settings.

## Agent data & tools

The **Data & tools** tab, displayed in the fly-out pane of a selected agent in the agent **Registry**, provides details about the selected agent can access and do within your organization. This tab surfaces three categories of agent metadata:
- **Capabilities** - How the agent can perform specific tasks and access data sources to provide accurate, contextual responses.
- **Knowledge sources** - Data that the agent uses to answer questions accurately.
- **Tools** - Processes that the agent uses to handle requests.

You can use this information to understand the data the agent has access to, the external sources it references, and the actions it can perform. By understanding these categories, you can make informed governance decisions about the agents deployed in your tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Admins with the **AI Administrator** or **Global Administrator** role have full access to view **Data & tools** for all agents. Use roles with the fewest permissions. Accounts with lower permissions help improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role. Limit its use to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

### View data and tools of an agent

To access the **Data and tools** tab for an agent, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Navigate to **Agents** > **All agents** > **Registry**.
3. Select an agent from the **Registry** list.
4. In the agent details pane, select the **Data & tools** tab.

The **Data & tools** tab is read-only and shows metadata reported by the agent platform. To change an agent's data sources or tools, the agent developer must update the agent configuration in the authoring platform, such as Copilot Studio, or Foundry. 

Some agents may have an empty **Data & tools** tab. This occurs based on the following conditions: 
- The agent developer didn't configure knowledge sources or tools for the agent.
- The agent type doesn't support these metadata fields. 
- The agent's metadata hasn't yet synced to Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Agent capabilities

The **Capabilities** section of the **Data & tools** tab shows the types of content and data sources the agent can access to provide accurate, contextual responses. 

The **Can read** section indicates the categories of content the agent has been granted read access to. The following table provides examples of content that can be included: 

| Category | Description | 
|---|---| 
| Public sites | Agent can read publicly accessible web content | 
| Organization files | Agent can read files within your Microsoft 365 tenant (SharePoint, OneDrive) | 
| Email | Agent can read user email content | 
| Calendar | Agent can read calendar events | 

> [!NOTE]
> The capabilities shown depend on the permissions configured for the agent and may vary by agent type and platform.
> 
> **Public sites** means the agent can access publicly available web content. This doesn't mean the agent has unrestricted internet access, it can read public web pages as a knowledge source to inform its responses.

### Agent knowledge sources

The **Knowledge sources** section provides data sources and URLs that the agent uses to answer questions accurately. These knowledge sources are the external or internal references the agent draws from when responding to user queries. 

The following table provides knowledge sources and examples that can be included with the agent: 

| Source type | Examples | 
|---|---| 
| Web URLs | `https://bing.com/`, `https://contoso.com/docs/` | 
| SharePoint sites | `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/hr-policies` | 
| Files and folders | Specific documents or folder paths configured as the agent's knowledge base | 
| Graph connectors | Data indexed via Microsoft Graph connectors | 

> [!NOTE]
> Review knowledge source URLs to verify the agent is only referencing approved, trusted sources. Unfamiliar or external URLs may indicate the agent has access to data outside your organization's boundaries.

### Agent tools

The **Tools** section, within the **Data & Tools** tab, provides the processes, connectors, and actions that the agent uses to handle requests. Tools represent what the agent can do, not just what it can read.

The following table provides tool types and examples that can be included with the agent: 

| Tool type | Examples | 
|---|---| 
| Microsoft 365 connectors | `shared_office365_ContactGetItem_V2` (reads contact data from Office 365) | 
| MCP servers | Third-party or customer-hosted MCP servers connected to the agent | 
| Work IQ tools | `Work IQ Mail (Preview)` (email-related actions) | 
| Custom actions | API actions defined by the agent developer | 

> [!NOTE]
> Each tool listed represents an action the agent can invoke at runtime. Review the tool list to understand the scope of what the agent can do on behalf of users. Tools that access external services or write data (send email, update records) warrant closer review.

### Data & tools by agent type

The metadata surfaced in the **Data & tools** tab varies depending on the agent type and platform. Agent type is largely based on the tool and method of creating the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Microsoft 365 admin center doesn't have data and tools information for all agents.

## Agent security

The **Security** tab helps you monitor agent activity, protect sensitive data, and evaluate compliance gaps based on Microsoft Purview protections.

> [!NOTE]
> A Microsoft E7 or Agent 365 license is required to see the **Risks** column in the Agent Registry and to see the **Security** tab details of an agent.

### View agent security details

To access the **Security** tab for an agent, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Navigate to **Agents** > **All agents** > **Registry**.
3. Select an agent from the **Registry** list.
4. In the agent details pane, select the **Security** tab.

The **Security** tab provides the following actions related to Microsoft Purview protections:
- Monitor agent activity
- Protect sensitive data
- Evaluate compliance gaps

#### Monitor agent activity

Interactions with a selected agent are monitored for security and observability. You can view agent activity using the **Activity explorer** in Microsoft Purview. Activity explorer allows you to review activity related to content that contains sensitive information, including label activity. Label activity is monitored across Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and endpoint devices. For more information, see [Get started with activity explorer](/purview/data-classification-activity-explorer).

#### Protect sensitive data

Protection for sensitive data helps prevent leaks and oversharing. You can view sensitive interactions using **AI observability** in Microsoft Purview. AI observability provides a centralized view of agent activity across your organization. For more information, see [Microsoft Purview data security and compliance protections for generative AI apps](/purview/ai-microsoft-purview).

#### Evaluate compliance gaps

If the selected agent has an AI baseline assessment available, you can evaluate compliance gaps for your agent. For more information, see [Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager](/purview/compliance-manager).

## Agent permissions

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, when granting permissions to agents, consider two types of permissions:

- **Application Permissions**
- **Delegated Permissions**

Each permission type grants different actions that agents can perform on behalf of users, depending on the scope of the access. This section explains these two types of permissions and provides an overview of the common permissions available.

### Application Permissions

**Application Permissions** let the agent access data and perform actions without requiring a user to sign in. These permissions let agents do tasks without needing a user to be signed in, like reading directory data, managing teams, or sending messages.

Key features of application permissions:

- **No user context required** - The agent can operate without an active user session.
- **Wide-reaching capabilities** - Agents with application permissions can act at the organizational level, allowing access to a large range of data.
- **Administrator consent required** - Administrator consent is typically required for granting application permissions.

#### Common Application Permissions

| Permission | Details |
| --- | ---|
| **Group.Read.All** | Read all groups in the organization. |
| **TeamsActivity.Send** | Send a teamwork activity to any user. |
| **RoleManagement.Read.Directory**| Read all directory role-based access control (RBAC) settings. |
| **User.Read.All** | Read all users' full profiles. |
| **Team.ReadBasic.All** | Get a list of all teams in the organization. |

### Delegated Permissions

**Delegated Permissions** allow the agent to act on behalf of a user when the user is signed in. These permissions provide access to user-specific data and allow agents to perform actions in the context of a particular user.

Use delegated permissions for applications where the agent interacts directly with the user's data or takes actions on their behalf.

#### Key features of delegated permissions

- **User context required** - The agent performs actions with the signed-in user's permission.
- **Granular access** - These permissions are typically more restricted, limiting access to only the user's data.
- **User consent might be required** - Depending on the permissions, users might need to grant consent for the application to act on their behalf.

#### Common delegated permissions

| Permission | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **User.ReadBasic.All** | Read all users' basic profiles. |
| **TeamsActivity.Send** | Send a teamwork activity to any user. |
| **RoleManagement.Read.Directory** | Read all directory role-based access control (RBAC) settings. |
| **User.Read.All** | Read all users' full profiles. |
| **Team.ReadBasic.All** | Get a list of all teams. |

### View permissions of an agent

You can find the details of all types of permissions in the **Permissions** tab on the agent details page.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Agents** > **All Agents** > **Registry**.
1. Select a deployed agent from the list.
1. In the agent details pane that opens, select the **Permissions** tab to view all the permissions granted to the agent.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/agents/agent-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Permissions tab on the agent details page in the Microsoft 365 admin center." lightbox="../../media/agents/agent-permissions.png":::

## Agent certification

The **Certification** tab provided in the agent's details pane in the Microsoft 365 admin center gives you a single place to review the trust and attestation signals that are available for the selected agent before you deploy the agent across your organization. For Microsoft-built agents and agents from external publishers, this tab surfaces the publisher attestation provided by the agent's developer, along with any Microsoft 365 Certification status that's been earned through Microsoft's app certification program. Publisher attestation captures the developer's self-reported information about how the agent handles data, security, and compliance. Microsoft 365 Certification reflects an independent security and compliance assessment that's valid for 12 months and helps confirm that the agent meets Microsoft's standards for handling tenant data. By reviewing the **Certification** tab alongside the **Overview**, **Data & tools**, and **Security** tabs, you can make an informed governance decision for the agent, where you can approve, deploy, block, or remove the agent. Your decision may largely be based on who built the agent, what it has been validated against, and the level of trust the publisher has documented.

## Agent activity

The **Activity** tab displayed in the agent details of the Microsoft 365 admin center gives you a focused view of how a single agent is being used and how it's performing across the tenant. By default, the metrics on this tab reflect the last 30 days, and you can adjust the date range to scope the view to a different time window. 

Additional details include the following:
- **Active users** - The number of unique users who interacted with the agent at least once during the selected date range. A user counts as active after a single interaction, regardless of how many times they engage with the agent.
- **Sessions** - The total count of complete agent invocations in which the agent performed a task, answered a query, or completed an interaction during the selected date range. A session represents one end‑to‑end instance of agent activity initiated by a trigger (such as an email, chat, or @mention) and includes all actions until the session ends.
- **Exceptions** - The percentage of sessions in the selected date range that completed without errors—that is, where the agent successfully finished the intended task. This metric helps administrators spot reliability issues and investigate agents that are failing to complete work as expected.
- **Agent run-time** -  The total agent‑assisted time over the selected date range, calculated as the sum of each session's duration (end time minus start time). Use this metric to gauge the overall workload an agent is carrying on behalf of users.

Snapshots provide agent activity:
- Active users over time
- Sessions over time
- Active users
  - User principal name
  - Total sessions
  - Last activity date (UTC)

> [!NOTE]
> The **Active users** table can be exported to a CSV file. The table also supports pagination.

These signals let you monitor, adoption, measure impact, and identify agents that need your attention. Agent that needs your attention may include high exception rates, low active-users counts, and long run-times. Activity metrics are currently supported for Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Builder, SharePoint, and Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit agent types.

## Agent instances

The **Instances** tab appears when you select an agent that is tagged as an **AI teammate** in the **Agent Registry**. AI teammate agents are agent templates from which your organization can instantiate one or more agent instances. Agent instances receive their own Microsoft Entra–backed agent identity, license, mailbox, OneDrive, and Teams presence so they can participate in Microsoft 365 workflows. 

 The **Instances** tab allows you to review a detailed table of all instances created from the selected agent. The table provides the following columns:

- **Name** - The name of the agent instance.
- **Email** - The email for the agent instance.
- **Status** - The status of the agent, such as **Active** or **Not active**.
- **Risks** - The number of detected risks.
- **Total sessions** - The total number of sessions over the last 30 days.
- **Owner** - The owner of the agent instance.
- 
Selecting a row opens that instance's details. Based on your assigned role (such as **AI Administrator** or **Global Administrator**), you can manage individual instance settings, review security and compliance status, assign or update Microsoft 365 licenses, and take lifecycle actions such as **Block**, **Unblock**, or **Delete** the instance.

For more information about agent instances, see [Create AI agent instances in Microsoft 365 admin center](create-agent-instances.md) and [Manage agent instances in Microsoft 365 admin center](manage-agent-instances.md).

## Connected agents

The **Connected Agents** tab allows you to connect the selected agent with other agents. When using the selected agent, users can get additional information and answers from the connected agents. You can connect up to 10 agents to the selected agent, excluding those added by the agent's maker. Depending on how the agent maker connected the agents, you may be able to remove them as well. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must make sure the connected agents are available to everyone who needs access.

The **Connected agents** tab provides a table of agents that are currently connected.

### Add a connected agent

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
1. Navigate to **Agents** > **All agents** > **Registry**.
1. Select an agent from the **Registry** list.
  The agent details will be displayed.
1. Select the **Connected agents** tab.
1. Select **Connect agents**.
1. Using the search box, add the name of the agent to connect.
1. Select the check-box next to the agent.
1. Select **Save**.

## Computer use

The **Computer use** tab appears in the agent details pane for select agents that support computer-use capabilities, such as Researcher. When an agent supports this feature, an extra **Computer use** tab is shown alongside the other agent details tabs. **Computer use** allows you to govern how the agent interacts with web content through a secure virtual computer. For Researcher specifically, you can extend Researcher beyond research and reasoning, allowing it to securely interact with public, gated, and interactive web content through a Windows 365–backed virtual computer. You can select whether Research can generate richer reports grounded in both their work data and the web. The **Computer use** tab is where you establish the guardrails before users can take advantage of these capabilities. 

The **Computer use** tab allows you to configure three primary policies that scope who can use the feature, what work data it can combine with the web, and which sites the virtual computer is allowed to reach:

- **Allow Researcher with Computer Use to perform actions on behalf of users**: Choose who in your organization can use Researcher with **Computer Use**. When access is disabled for a user, the **Computer use** option appears grayed out in the Researcher experience. 
- **Allow Researcher to access work data**: Control whether users can combine enterprise data (such as emails, chats, and files) with web-based research during a **Computer use** session. 
- **Choose which websites are allowed for Computer Use**: Define which sites the virtual computer is allowed to navigate. 

For more information, see [Researcher with Computer Use admin configuration](#researcher-with-computer-use-admin-configuration).

## Manage agents with embedded file content as a knowledge source

Agent creators can use [Agent Builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agent-builder-build-agents) to upload files for the agent to use as knowledge. Copilot stores the uploaded files in tenant-owned [SharePoint Embedded](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/overview) containers. It then embeds the file content as knowledge for the agent to use in responses. For more information, see [Embedded file content](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agent-builder-add-knowledge#embedded-file-content).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> [Microsoft Purview Information Barriers (IB)](/purview/information-barriers) isn't supported on embedded files. Any user who can access the agent can see responses grounded in the embedded file content.

This article explains how to handle embedded files, how you can manage agents and containers, and what to expect with sensitivity labels and deletion workflows.

#### Supported file types and limits

:::image type="content" source="../../media/knowledge-agent-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the screen to upload a file as a knowledge source for an agent." lightbox="../../media/knowledge-agent-upload.png":::

Embedded knowledge agents support uploading files as knowledge sources. Copilot only uses the text content of these files for grounding.

#### Supported file types

- .doc, .docx
- .ppt, .pptx
- .xls, .xlsx
- .pdf
- .txt

#### Maximum file size

| File type | Maximum file size |
| --- | --- |
| .doc, .ppt, .xls, .xlsx, .txt | 150 MB |
| .docx, .pptx, and .pdf | 512 MB |

Files that exceed these limits aren't accepted.

#### Maximum number of files

Users can upload up to 20 files per agent.

#### SharePoint Embedded containers

When you upload a file to an agent, Copilot stores the file in a SharePoint Embedded container. The Microsoft 365 service automatically creates this container and your organization owns it. The container appears in the SharePoint admin center and PowerShell under the application name Declarative Agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Don't delete these containers. Deleting these containers might break the functionality of agents that rely on them.

#### View agent metadata

In the **All agents** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can filter the agent inventory to view only agents that use embedded files as knowledge sources.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/knowledge-agent-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the agents and connectors page in the Microsoft 365 admin center with the filters highlighted." lightbox="../../media/knowledge-agent-filter.png":::

For each agent, the following metadata is available:

- **File name** - The name of the uploaded file.
- **File sensitivity** - The sensitivity label applied to the file.
- **SharePoint container ID** - The unique identifier for the container storing the file.

This metadata helps you track and audit the use of embedded content across agents.

#### Sensitivity labels and access control

The service applies sensitivity labels to the embedded content in the agent based on the most restrictive label from the uploaded files. The following rules determine how the service applies sensitivity labels:

- Whichever of the following labels are more restrictive:

  - Most restrictive sensitivity label of all files uploaded. For example, the highest priority of the labels on the uploaded files.
  - If your organization configured and applied a [default sensitivity label policy](/purview/default-sensitivity-labels-policies#default-sensitivity-label-policy).

- If a default sensitivity labeling policy is in place, the service automatically assigns a label.

- The service only applies sensitivity labels if:

  - You create the agent by using Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Builder.
  - The agent includes embedded files.

You can view the sensitivity label for each agent in the **Overview** tab of the Microsoft 365 admin center.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/knowledge-agent-idea.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the overview details of an agent." lightbox="../../media/knowledge-agent-idea.png":::

#### User access and visibility

- If a user doesn't have extract rights to any of the sensitivity labels applied to the uploaded files, they can't access the agent.

- If a user has extract rights, they can view the agent's sensitivity label in the agent details pane.

For more information, see [Sensitivity labels for agent embedded content](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-lite-knowledge#sensitivity-labels-for-agent-embedded-content).

#### Researcher with Computer Use admin configuration

For **Researcher with Computer Use** onboarding instructions, see the following short video:

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3vLF9mnd8w?si=XJaYnCQYNy_CeuFc]

**Researcher with Computer Use** is a powerful extension that builds on the capabilities of the Researcher agent. By using Computer Use, the Researcher agent can securely interact with public, gated, and interactive web content through a virtual computer. By using this method, users can uncover deeper insights, take action, and generate richer reports grounded in both their work data and the web. For more information, see [Use Researcher with Computer use in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/1f274537-6648-46e8-8264-052a49b92af4).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/agents/researcher.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Researcher with Computer Use." lightbox="../../media/agents/get-started.png":::

##### Configure admin settings for Researcher agent with Computer Use

To configure admin settings for **Researcher agent with Computer Use**, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Microsoft Admin Controls (Microsoft 365 admin center) Agents** page.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Researcher under Agents**, and check if there's another tab for **Computer Use**.

You can access key metadata for Copilot agents in **Agents** > **All Agents**. When you select an agent, you see the metadata in the **Data & tools** tab.

The metadata includes details such as the agent's capabilities, data sources, and custom actions. Example data sources include OneDrive and SharePoint files and sites, or Graph connectors. Metadata is only for custom agents, which are designed to perform specific tasks based on predefined rules and configurations.
