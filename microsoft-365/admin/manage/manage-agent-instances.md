# Manage agent instances in Microsoft 365 admin center

Once an admin activates an agent, requestor can create instances of that agent. The Microsoft 365 admin center provides a centralized view for managing these instances:

- **Agent Registry** - Navigate to **Agents** > **All agents** > **Registry**. You can view agents with the **AI teammate** tag. You'll also the number of instances that have been created for the specific agent.

- **Agent Details** - Select an agent to open a flyout panel that displays the agent details. Select the **Instances** tab in the panel.

- **Instance** tab - Select the **Instances** tab to display a detailed list of all instances created under that agent. From this panel, administrators can perform the following actions:

  - **Manage individual instances** - Access and update settings for each instance.
  - **Review security and compliance status** - Ensure every instance meets organizational standards.
  - **Apply and customize licenses** - Assign licenses and configure options at the instance level.

This streamlined experience helps administrators maintain control, compliance, and flexibility across all agent instances.
