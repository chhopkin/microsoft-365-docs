# Manage License Reservations for volume licensing

A *License Reservation* lets a customer get started immediately with online services, without going through the standard order submission process, first.

This article explains reservation restrictions, the online services available for reservation, and how reservations are invoiced. It also includes steps for how to make, cancel, and view your License Reservations in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

## Before you begin

- You must have the volume licensing (VL) Administrator or the Online Service Manager (OSM) role for the corresponding License ID to create and manage online reservations in the admin center.
- You must have an agreement type of Enterprise, Enterprise Subscription, or Enterprise Agreement (EA) for Government Partners.
- If you're a Licensing Solution Partner, you must be added as a VL external user and be granted the OSM role by a customer VL Administrator before you can make reservations on behalf of that customer.

- All Reservations usage dates start at midnight Pacific Standard Timezone (PST). 

> [!NOTE]
> Placing a volume licensing reservation is a different action from assigning the licenses to users. You must contact your Global Administrator for seat assignment.

## License Reservation restrictions

License Reservations have the following restrictions:

- Only online services are eligible for License Reservation orders.
- A reservation order is a financial obligation that's realized during the annual true-up order process, based on the reservation usage date and the quantity of licenses reserved.
- You can place a reservation order for the current date or for a date that is no more than six months in the future.
- You can cancel reservation orders up to 72 hours from the start of the usage date, defined as midnight Pacific Standard Timezone (PST), including weekends and holidays.
- Reservations can't be made if the enrollment is expired or is in the last 30 days of the agreement anniversary. Instead, consult your Microsoft Reseller about ordering options.

> [!NOTE]
> You don’t need to place an online reservation to renew services you already use. Instead, contact your Microsoft partner or seller to renew your existing seats before they expire. Renewals don't add more seats or more services.

## Online services available for License Reservations

To reduce the risk that customers unintentionally order incorrect or incompatible services, not all Microsoft services are available to reserve in the admin center. The following list explains the three types of available services:

1. Standard online services are available to EA customers on the VL <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2297441" target="_blank">Reservations</a> page in the admin center.
1. A second category of services is only available if customers have either a prior purchase or pre-agreed pricing for that service.
1. A third category of more complex services isn't configured for online reservation and must be ordered via your Microsoft partner or seller.

If you want to use a Microsoft online service not listed on the **Reservations** page, contact your Microsoft seller or Licensing Solution Partner for help with placing the necessary purchase order.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to subscribe to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, contact your Microsoft seller or Licensing Solution Partner. You can't reserve seats for Azure in the VL pages of the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Invoicing License Reservation orders

As part of your VL agreement's annual order process, your Microsoft partner or seller submits purchase orders to invoice you based on the reservation usage date and the quantity of licenses reserved.

All the licenses committed to in the License Reservation are invoiced, even if some of the licenses aren't in use.

> [!NOTE]
> When your partner places an order to reconcile the License Reservation, the reservation status in the admin center changes from "active" to "canceled".

Reservations canceled more than 72 hours before the usage date aren't invoiced.

If you have any questions that relate to invoices resulting from the reconciliation of reserved licenses into VL orders, contact your Microsoft partner or seller.

## Make a License Reservation order

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A License Reservation order is a financial commitment to purchase reserved items. If you don't have the authority to accept this commitment, work with the person in your organization who is authorized to do so.

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">**Your products**</a> page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2244144" target="_blank">Volume licensing</a> tab.

   > - Selecting a usage date within 60 days of your anniversary date might affect your ability to step-up to higher edition licenses. Speak with your Microsoft partner or seller first.
   > - Customers can’t place a reservation within 30 days of the agreement's end date. Instead, ask your partner or seller to submit an order on your behalf.

## Volume licensing reservation usage dates

- The usage date in a volume licensing reservation is the date when the service should be available for use in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
- All reservation usage dates start at midnight Pacific Standard Time (PST).  
- Customers whose local time zone is one day ahead of PST see an option to select the previous date in the reservation calendar. Use this option to ensure that the services are available in the correct local time.    
- If the selected usage date is a future date, the services won't be available before the commencement of the usage date. 
- If the usage date is more than 24 hours ago and the services aren't yet available, contact volume licensing support.
