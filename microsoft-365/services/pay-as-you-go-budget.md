# Set up a budget for pay-as-you-go billing in Microsoft 365

This article explains how to set spending limits for pay-as-you-go billing—currently available for Microsoft 365 Copilot services (other services available in a future release). This feature helps you monitor usage, receive alerts as costs approach budget thresholds, and plan more effectively.

Budgets are set at the billing policy level, not for individual users, agents, or sites. This means any limits or alerts apply to all services and users under that policy.


## Prerequisites

To access the Microsoft 365 admin center, users must be assigned one of the following roles:

- [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator)
- [AI Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#ai-administrator)
- [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users with the [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader) role can view billing policies and budgets, but they can't view spending data.


<!---


- Users with the [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator), [AI Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#ai-administrator), or [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader) role can access the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Users with the [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader) role can view billing policies and budgets, but can't see spending data.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Admin role**:
    - You must have either the [SharePoint Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) or [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) role to access the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Permission levels**:
    - Users with contributor access can view and edit budget settings.
    - Users with reader access can view billing policies, but can't see spending data or budget details.

## Set up a budget

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Go to **Copilot** > **Billing & usage**.

3. On the **Billing policies** tab, select the policy you want to manage.

4. On the policy panel, select the **Budget** tab.

5. Select **Spending** to view current expenses for services linked to the policy. There can be up to a four-hour delay before consumption data appears in the graph.

6. Select **Settings** to configure your budget and alert preferences.

    a. Select the **Set limits for this billing policy** checkbox.

    b. Under **Budget**, enter the dollar amount for your spending limit.

    c. Under **Reset the budget**, select when you want to reset the budget.

    - Monthly (resets on the first day of each month)
    - Quarterly (resets on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1)
    - Yearly (resets on January 1)

    d. Under **Send email alerts** (optional):

    - Add recipients (only [mail-enabled security groups](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group) are currently supported).

    - Set the budget percentage that triggers alerts.

        - If selected, 100% is enabled by default.

        - You can add up to four additional thresholds (1–99%).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Email alerts can be delayed by up to 24 hours. Alerts are currently sent from Azure but will transition to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a future release.

7. Select **Save** to apply your budget settings.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The only way to stop billing is to [disconnect the payment method](pay-as-you-go-setup-copilot.md#disconnect-pay-as-you-go-billing). Reaching 100% of your budget doesn't stop the service or billing.

    > 
    > Budget email alerts are currently sent from Azure. However, you can still view and manage your budget in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This behavior will be updated in a future release so that alerts are sent directly from the admin center.

    d. Under **Send email alerts**, you can add recipients to receive budget notifications and set the budget percentage that will trigger an alert.
